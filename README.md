- 👋 Hi, I’m Peter Woollard AKA @Woolly-at-EBI
- 👀 I’m interested in making life science data FAIR. My particular interest is in public standard aligned, consistent and rich metadata as IMHO this is fundamental to getting the most out of data. 
- 🌱 I’m currently working on:
  1) Experimental checklists and JSON schema (for validating data record submissions).
  2) Updating many of the ENA versions of GSC checklists to be v6 compliant. + adding 4 extra ones.
  3) working with marine and freshwater metadata
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on biological metadata standards that align with ENA and associated project needs.
- N.B. Most of my important projects migrate to the enasequence github when they are beyond the exploratory phase.
- 📫 How to reach me:  woollard@ebi.ac.uk or linkedin.
