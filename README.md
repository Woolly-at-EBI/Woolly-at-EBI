- 👋 Hi, I’m Peter Woollard AKA @Woolly-at-EBI
- 👀 I’m interested in making life science data FAIR. My particular interest is in public standard aligned, consistent and rich metadata as IMHO this is fundamental to getting the most out of data. 
- 🌱 I’m currently working on:
  1) Enhancing marine metadata for the BlueCloud project.
  2) Experimental checklists and JSON schema (for validating data record submissions).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on biological metadata standards that align with ENA and associated project needs.
- 📫 How to reach me:  woollard@ebi.ac.uk or linkedin.
